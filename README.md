# lancer-alternative-structure-rules

Uses [Maria's Alternative Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unN3HDDeAK3pN1rmgFgZgAXp5flnQ9-KMu-TXt34tnU/edit) for Lancer.

## Changelog

* 0.1.0
    * Initial release candidate
    * Rules provided by [Maria's Alternative Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unN3HDDeAK3pN1rmgFgZgAXp5flnQ9-KMu-TXt34tnU/edit)
    * Currently supports all structure cases except not having any systems left on a `System Trauma` case, however this isn't supported by the base game anyway.
